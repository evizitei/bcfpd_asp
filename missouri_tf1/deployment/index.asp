An <b>alert</b> is an “information-only” notification and does not constitute a request for mobilization. When an <b>alert</b> notification is received, Task Force members should determine their availability and ensure that their personal gear bags and field web gear are ready for possible deployment. Unless specifically asked to do so, Task Force members should not contact the Fire District office.
