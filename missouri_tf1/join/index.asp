	<tr>
		<td class="Content">As you will see from the website information, the efforts to develop and maintain Missouri Task Force 1 have been and continue to be significant.  To be a functional member of American’s Urban Search and Rescue Task Force System, an incredible amount of work and commitment is required.  Present members of our Task Force have made that commitment and, as a result of their efforts, Missouri’s Task Force has grown very quickly to be a highly capable and proficient Urban Search and Rescue resource.
		</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td class="Content">It is important to understand that membership in the Task Force is taken very seriously.  These resources may be called upon at any time to perform highly intensive, stressful and dangerous missions.  As a member of an urban search and rescue task force deployed to a catastrophic event, you will be called upon to engage the most graphic, demanding, dangerous and heavily scrutinized challenge you will, potentially, ever undertake.  To perform these missions efficiently and safely requires an extremely high level of expertise and confidence.  In reviewing the information, you will find that the training and participation requirements are extensive.  The training regimen is strict and the participation requirements are critical to the development of teamwork.  In short, we need legitimate participants who are willing to meet and exceed the minimum requirements to insure our long-term effectiveness, team continuity and stability under the worst of conditions.  We will accept nothing less.

Task Force members shall not have any medical condition that would inhibit their ability to perform arduous work in an austere environment.  Applicants should have a particular skill or ability that makes them of value to the Task Force.  In addition, applicants should have a high school diploma or equivalent.

However, due to deployment requirements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, all Task Force members should be able to arrive either in Columbia or at Whitman Air Force Base in western Missouri within four hours of notification for deployment.

We have canine specialists from Kansas City, suburban St. Louis and Springfield.  Rescue specialists are from Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis.  Physicians, nurses and paramedics are staff members at the University of Missouri Hospital and Clinics.  Structural engineers come from the private industry and public sector.  Missouri Task Force 1 is truly a volunteer force.  Its strongest asset is the diversity of team members.

With your application, please attach all applicable certifications and training certificates or records to support the application.

The cost to completely outfit a team member is nearly $1,500. To support you during deployment, the Task Force provides for all your personal needs such as meals and housing.  Additionally, Workers’ Compensation and liability coverage is provided to Task Force members while engaged in Task Force activities.

		<td class="Content">When deployed under direction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Task Force members are paid on a set scale according to their duties and responsibilities.  In addition, should you have to take time off from your work, your employer will be compensated to back fill your position with another employee during your Federal deployment (above and beyond your normal salary).  There are no provisions such as this for an in-state deployment.  Your activation in-state will be a voluntary commitment with no salary or employer back-fill reimbursement.

In 1997, three deployment exercises were conducted; two were conducted in Boone County area and were two days in length.  The other exercises were conducted in concert with the United States Air Force at a military base in Oklahoma and were a three day mission.

As of January 1, 2000, nearly 90,000 training and equipment preparation hours had been expended in preparing the Task Force and its members for a response.  As a FEMA disaster resource, Missouri Task Force 1 is structured according to set Federal organizational guidelines.  Once selected, you will be assigned to one of five areas within the team; administrative (Task Force Leader, Safety or Planning), Search Team (Canine and Technical Search), Rescue Team (Rescue Specialists), Medical Team (Physicians, Nurses and Paramedics) or Technical Team (Structural Engineers, Heavy Riggers, Hazardous Materials Specialists, Technical Information, Logisticians and Communications Specialists).

The Task Force is completely self-sufficient, so when deployed, no strain is placed on the affected community.  Over 16,400 pieces of high and low technical equipment are part of the disaster response.  Everything from search cameras and borescopes to locate trapped victims to portable toilets, toothpaste and sleeping bags are sent with the Task Force.
