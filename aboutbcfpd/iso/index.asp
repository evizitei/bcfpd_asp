Fire protection encompasses fire department stations, equipment, personnel, training, maintenance, etc.  Community water supply encompasses size and locations of fire hydrants, water main sizes, water storage tank/towers, wells/pumps, etc.  Communications encompasses the emergency dispatch center, 911 telephone system, back-up generators for the system, etc.
