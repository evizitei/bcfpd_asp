		<td class="Content"><p>Since the development of the organization in the mid 1960’s, there have been several department patches worn on the uniform.  While those patches have changed in their style and configuration over the years, one slogan has remained constant on every generation of patch.  “A Helping Hand” was the Central Missouri Radio Squad’s originating slogan and a philosophy we continue to hold dear to our hearts today.

	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>One of the unique characteristics of the organization is that it is not what many would call a traditional fire department.  It is an organization made up of men and women who want to help their neighbor in any fashion possible.  In addition to "mainstream" functions that all fire departments provide, it is not uncommon to see the volunteers of the Boone County Fire Protection District assisting a farmer return his cattle to his fields following a fence failure, assisting a citizen with the removal of a dangerous snake from their house, assisting an elderly bedridden resident return to their bed following a fall or providing someone with a ride home following a minor traffic accident.  We also do cats!

	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>The Boone County Fire Protection District is the community’s helping hand and it is that philosophy that has provided the fundamental foundation upon which a very extensive and respected organization has been developed.  The organization and, more importantly, its volunteers continue to seek new opportunities to serve, not only in Boone County but, throughout our state and nation.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>Today’s patch is designed to more appropriately depict the District’s role in fire, rescue and emergency medicine.  Also depicted is our commitment to education-both external through public fire and life safety education and internal through our intensive training program.  The helmet signifies the volunteer firefighter who is the heart and soul of the organization.  Of course, “A Helping Hand” continues to demonstrate the District’s philosophy about its relationship with the community it serves.
