These firefighters are not paid to perform their functions with the Boone County Fire District.  Many are employed in other vocations, some are self-employed and others are students.  They give of their time and talents out of a strong desire and commitment to assist their fellow man in this noble calling.

Should none of the volunteer firefighters be in the station at the time of the alarm, other volunteer firefighters in the immediate area will respond to the fire station to drive the fire apparatus to the scene.  Other volunteer firefighters, likewise, respond directly to the scene in their personnel vehicles. Some, following proper training and qualification, operate blue lights and sirens on their vehicles to facilitate their response.

	  <td colspan="7" valign="top" class="Content">A strong attribute of Boone County&#146;s volunteer system is the likelihood that volunteer personnel may be much closer to the scene of an emergency than the fire station, itself.  It is very common for firefighters to arrive on the emergency scene prior to the fire apparatus.  Capable of providing emergency medical care, rescue or limited firefighting activities, their early intervention often makes a significant difference in the outcome of an event.
