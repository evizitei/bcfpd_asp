In 1963, an elderly handicapped woman died in a house fire immediately west of the city limits of Columbia.  A small band of CB Radio enthusiasts, which called themselves the Central Missouri Radio Squad, came together and determined that someone must take the initiative to develop a rural fire protection system for Boone County.

		<td colspan="10" class="Content">In 1964, in an abandoned chicken house on Route PP northeast of Columbia, the Central Missouri Radio Squad Volunteer Fire Department was formed.  The first fire apparatus was an old milk delivery truck donated by Mr. J. Patrick Barnes.  Pat Barnes continues to volunteer today as the District&#146;s First Assistant Fire Chief.  The first fire chief was John Dineen, a safety specialist for Columbia Mutual Insurance Companies.  Donations were solicited, volunteers purchased gasoline out of their own pockets and some items were literally stolen during the early phases of development.  Initial protection was provided through a membership or &#147;fire tag&#148; system that allowed Boone County residents to purchase fire protection for five dollars per year.  In late 1964, sufficient funds were raised to start the construction of what was to become the first &#147;real&#148; fire station in the organization.  This station was established on Route PP, approximately ½ mile east of what is presently Highway 63.  Additional equipment was acquired through military surplus and additional donations. The organization began to grow.

The volunteer firefighters of the Central Missouri Radio Squad campaigned actively throughout Boone County in an effort to form what was to become the first out-state fire protection district (outside the St. Louis/Kansas City area).  With a voter approval rate of 375 ayes and 229 nays, the Boone County Fire Protection District was formed on July 11, 1970.

This was one of the first programs of its kind in the country and a program that now comprises approximately 60% of all emergency responses within the Fire District.  Also in 1977, the Columbia/Boone County Joint Communications Center went online, which combined the dispatching functions of all the emergency services in Boone County and which continues to operate to this day.  This system provides a more economically efficient system and, simultaneously, provides better coordination of all emergency services in Boone County.

Additionally, during this same election, an increase in the general revenue fund was authorized by the voters, which allowed the organization to hire additional support personnel and enhance many of the support programs.  As a result of the capital improvements project, an additional twelve pieces of fire equipment were purchased, new stations were established on Route E northwest of Columbia, on Route WW east of Columbia and new stations were constructed in Sturgeon and Centralia.  Additions were made to fire stations in Harrisburg and Rocheport.

In the late 1990&#146;s, this was accomplished, significantly expanding the rescue capabilities of the organization locally, statewide and nationally.  The Fire District, under the banner of Missouri Task Force 1, is now one of only 28 FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task forces in the United States and is available for deployment to disasters throughout the country upon a Presidential disaster declaration.

This life safety program, taught in all fourth grade classrooms in the Fire District by Boone County volunteer firefighters, was awarded the IAFC&#146;s Excellence Award in international competition.
