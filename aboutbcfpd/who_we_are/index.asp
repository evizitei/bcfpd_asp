They are farmers, professors, physicians, insurance agents, secretaries, law enforcement officers, university students, housewives, contractors, salesmen, business owners, mechanics, ministers and computer programmers.  They share a common desire - to make a contribution to their community.

		<td class="Content"><p>It takes a special breed of individual to volunteer their time in this arena.  Boone County’s volunteer fire fighters spend time in training, equipment preparation and many other support activities.  Most importantly, they spend time responding to the needs of their neighbors and community residents who are need of their assistance.  They are  often likened to minutemen or sentries standing guard over the community, ready to spring into action on a minute’s notice.  They carry pagers and make themselves available during all hours of the day and night, in good and bad weather to assist when needed.  Each does this freely and willingly knowing "if not me, who?"
