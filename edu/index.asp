This program is designed to provide Fire District officers and senior firefighters with an overview of how to manage common incident types utilizing the following format:
<ul>
<li>Introduction and Objectives</li>
<li>Managing The Incident</li>
<li>Safety Issues</li>
<li>Standard Outcomes</li>
<li>Applying Concepts - Review Exercise</li>
</ul></p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;"><img src="/edu/images/ODSHomePage2.JPG" border="1" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">This program should be used in conjunction with other Fire District educational programs and is designed to enhance the senior firefighter and officers’ training in incident management. This program allows you to work at your own pace. Arrows on each page allow you to move forward and backwards through the material. A pull-down menu allows you to move to any page in the module. Placing your mouse cursor on certain colored text causes pop-up boxes with additional information to display. Selecting (double-clicking) other colored text allows you to open additional documents for review or listen to audio files. Please review all of the available information on a particular page before continuing on to the next page. Each lesson will begin and end with a short quiz. The quizzes and worksheets are Microsoft Word documents. There are links to other documents that require the use of Adobe Acrobat Reader. If you don’t have Adobe Acrobat Reader you may download it <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">here</a>.</p>
