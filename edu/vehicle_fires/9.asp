Develop your Incident Organization. What does your organizational chart look like? No freelancing. All personnel are assigned or in <a href="#">staging.<span>A Staging Area is a temporary location at an incident where personnel and equipment are kept while awaiting tactical assignment. Resources in staging area are always available. That is to say, ready to go out on assignment immediately.</span></a></p>


<p>Maintain a reasonable <a href="#">Span of Control<span>The number of individuals managed by a single supervisor. The manageable span of control for one supervisor ranges from between three to seven individuals, with five as optimum.</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>Establish <a href="#">Incident Zones<span>The purpose of implementing incident control zones is to:  secure a scene; establish perimeters; maintain safe and efficient control over operating personnel;  and to prevent people, vehicles, and resource equipment from entering a threatening situation. The incident scene may be divided into three separate zones:  HOT, WARM and COLD (safe).  The hot zone denotes the area of maximum hazard, the warm zone surrounds and includes the hot zone, and the cold zone is the unrestricted area beyond the boundaries of the warm zone.</span></a> and manage accordingly.
<ul>
<li>Hot zone - area of maximum hazard, also called the incident action circle</li>
<li>Warm Zone - transition activities, tool and equipment staging</li>
<li>Cold zone - safe zone, ICP, rehab</li>

</ul>
Announce <a href="#">Tactical Benchmarks<span><li>Primary All Clear: primary search is complete
<li>Secondary All Clear: secondary search is complete
<li>Water of the Fire: extinguishment of the fire has begun
<li>Under Control: the event is controlled and can be managed with units that are on the scene.
<li>Loss Stopped: property conservation is complete.</span></a> when they've been achieved.
