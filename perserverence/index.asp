		<td class="Content">The Boone County Fire Protection District has established an endowment fund for the benefit and protection of all firefighters and their families in Boone County. The Perseverance Endowment is available to personnel of the Boone County Fire Protection District, Columbia Fire Department, Southern Boone County Fire Protection District and Centralia Fire Department.
			
			<p><img style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" align="left" SRC="/images/perserverence/firefighterphoto2.jpg" border="3">Today&#146;s firefighters face greater risks than ever before. In addition to &#147;routine&#148; firefighting duties, fire service personnel face challenges from chemical fires and spills, high-risk rescues, acts of terrorism and emergency medical responses. Firefighting continues to hold the distinction of being the most hazardous vocation in the United States.</p>

			<p>The Perseverance Endowment is used to address general areas of need for firefighters and their families, such as support to the dependents of a firefighter who died or was disabled in the line of duty, including scholarships for dependent children. The fund, which is supported by private tax-deductible contributions, is used to augment pre-existing programs, and is administered by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Boone County Fire Protection District Board of Directors. Contributions to the endowment are needed and should be sent via the enclosed response envelope. Individuals, businesses or organizations wishing to make annual, sustaining contributions to the endowment should do so by contacting the Fire District directly. Fire District staff will work with you to ensure that your annual contribution to the Perseverance Endowment is recognized as a traditional component of your annual community and charitable contributions. </p>

			<p>To celebrate the achievements of our volunteers, the Fire District commissioned nationally renowned artist Harry Weber to create a bronze tribute to the men and women who so nobly and humbly serve mid-Missouri. The statue, appropriately named &#147;Perseverance,&#148; honors volunteerism and professionalism and is now on display in Volunteer Plaza at the Fire District headquarters facility. </p>
		
			<p>In addition to Fire District staff, members of the Perseverance Endowment Steering Committee would be happy to answer any questions you may have. </p>
