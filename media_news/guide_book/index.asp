							<li>You have 24-hour access to the Boone County Fire District Public Information Officer.  We maintain a <b>NEWS MEDIA HOTLINE</b> and should you have a question related to an emergency event in Boone County, contact the Public Information Officer at 573-876-7600.
							<li>When driving to the scene of an emergency, please follow all traffic laws. Do not try to keep up with an emergency vehicle should one pass you.
							<li>When you arrive on the emergency scene, park your vehicle on the same side of the road as the emergency responders.
							<li>Dress for the conditions. Emergency scenes are usually wet, muddy or full of debris. 
							<li>Report to the Command Post to locate the Public Information Officer (PIO). The Command Post is usually marked by a rotating green light or flag indicating “Command Post.”  From here you will be directed to the media area and information officer. If you are unsure, ask any firefighter to assist you, or look for a firefighter with a white helmet, which indicates a command officer.
							<li>Understand that during an emergency incident, the primary objective is to save lives and protect property. Information will be relayed to the press as quickly as possible. Persons assigned to assist you understand the deadlines you work under and will provide information as it becomes available.
							<li>When you report to the media area and PIO, he/she will brief you as to dangers on the scene. In addition to emergency scenes being wet and muddy, they are also very dangerous. Walls can fall, power lines can come down and explosions may occur. You will not be restricted in your movements other than to keep you alive and uninjured.
							<li>Following the incident, should additional information become available, it will be forwarded to your newsroom. 
							<li>Each morning, Monday through Friday we fax to each media outlet our daily MEDIA REPORT that lists the emergency incidents we have responded to in the last 24 hours. This report is also available via our web page, www.bcfdmo.com.

USAR task forces were used extensively at the Murrah Federal Building bombing in Oklahoma City and the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa. Only 28 of these specialized teams exist in the nation and can be deployed throughout the United States and its territories should a natural or man-made disaster occur. The Task Force consists of 62 highly trained rescue, medical, search and technical specialists, who must be able to leave with the Task Force at a moments notice and are trained to find persons trapped under tons of concrete and steel. Missouri Task Force 1 has cooperative agreements with the University of Missouri Hospital & Clinics, which provides the entire medical equipment cache, as well as emergency trauma surgeons, nurses and paramedics. The Task Force, designed to be self-contained for at least 96 hours, carries more than 16,200 pieces of equipment worth nearly $1.3 million.
