	    <td colspan="7" vAlign="top" class="Content">Since 1988, the Boone County Fire District has operated and supported an out-of-state wildland fire crew for national deployment to major forest fires throughout the country.  Participants on this fire crew volunteer their time for this program and are trained and certified to U.S. Forest Service standards.  Once deployed, firefighters are placed on the federal payroll and are paid directly by the U.S. Forest Service while on assignment.  The Fire District continues to be the only fire department in Missouri that is a cooperating organization to the Missouri Department of Conservation and the U.S. Forest Service in the out-of-state program.

		<td colspan="7" vAlign="top" class="Content">This unique program has provided the Fire District with several advantages. First, it has allowed our personnel to expand their experiences and involvement beyond Boone County. Boone County&#146;s volunteers are incredibly enthusiastic and truly enjoy any opportunity that allows them increased opportunities such as this. The program also allows the Fire District to gain experience and knowledge in the western wildland fire environment that is easily transferable for application here in Boone County. The Fire District&#146;s formal involvement in the program also makes federal training much more readily available to our personnel.
