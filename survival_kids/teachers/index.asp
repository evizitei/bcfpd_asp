		<td class="Content">Welcome to the TEACHER'S LOUNGE. This area will provide you with the SURVIVAL KIDS curriculum information. SURVIVAL KIDS is an educational and entertaining method of presenting important life safety and survival skills to elementary age children. Created by the Boone County Fire District in 1994, SURVIVAL KIDS has graduated nearly 5,000 3rd and 4th grade children. Each lesson is based upon a core educational element, such as science, english, math or history.

		<td class="Content"><p>One of the critical fundamentals of the SURVIVAL KIDS programs that has proven successful, is the use of our firefighters as the lesson instructors. We understand that the demands placed upon children and teachers during the school year often prevents new programs from being explored. Our lessons use the firefighter as the "technical expert" who knows and understands the topic. We realize that asking the teachers to present the curriculum would doom our program to failure as the school day is already jammed full of important lessons which demand the teachers attention.
