<!--When you leave town on vacation, tell  someone where you are going, when you  expect to return and how to reach you.  if a big storm blows through and your  house is damaged or destroyed, you can  be contacted and informed. Before you leave, stop your mail and  newspaper delivery. Papers piled up in  the driveway and mail stuffed into the  mailbox is like a big sign pointing at  your home that says NOBODY'S HOME. Use automatic light timers to turn on  and off the lights in your home. A  lived in home is a less likely target  for a burglar. Pack your vehicle with not only the  cooler and beach clothes, but also  check to make sure your spare tire is  inflated; you have some jumbper cables,  maybe some road flares, small fire  extinguisher and even a personal first  aid kit. It is okay to stop to help at an accident  along the highway, just understand that  some fire departments may welcome  the help, others may quickly send you on  your way. Always wear you set belt and everyone  in your vehicle should be belted in. No  exceptions! When you arrive at your destination and check into the hotel, do Ken's Quick Escape  Check. Be on a lower floor if in a high-rise (anything below the 6th floor is good,  lower is beter). Have a room toward the end of the hallway. GO to your room and then  count the number of doors between your room and the exit door. GO tot he exit door  and make sure that it opens. GO down the stairwell and make sure you can get out.  Okay, now you know where to go in a fire. If you have opted for a vacation at the beach,  woods, desert, mountains, or some other place  where small animals, big animals, sneaky  animals, or a variety of crawling or flying insects  might bite or eat you, check with a Park Ranger or  someone to learn about this important  information. If you opt for a hike in the backwoods,  mountain climbing or other venture, again,  tell someone where you are going, the  route you intend to take and when you  expect to return. Dress appropriately for  the climate . For remote  treks, carry a  peronsal survival kit. If you have set your sights on a vacation in  the urban jungle like LA or New York where  ther might be a variety of small animals,  sneaky people, unscrupulous vendors,  hucksters, or others that might see you as  an easy mark, check with someone who has  been to these locations to learn about how  to protect yourself from getting ripped  off. At the ocean, find out if there are rip tides  or undertows. That is real important  information if you go swimming Many communities don't yet have 9-1-1  emergency telephone number. the local fire,  police and ambulance number would typically be  located inside the front cover of the telephone  book. You can also dial 0 for the Operator. Having  no 9-1-1 also means that you will have to know  where you are and where the mergency is since  the location will not come up on a dispatcher's  screen. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
