Their energy, inquisitive minds and availability (between classes) have proven to be highly desirable.  The Boone County Fire District welcomes applications from student firefighters.  Firefighters must be 18 years of age upon commencing the recruit-training program.

		<td class="Content"><p>Exposure to emergency service delivery during one’s college experience has proven to be highly beneficial from a maturity and responsibility standpoint.  Countless student firefighters have told us that their college experience would not have been as successful had it not been for their relationship with the Fire District.

	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>Additionally, the Fire District operates a station resident program.  All Fire District stations are equipped with dorm-like bedrooms designed for privacy and convenience.  Some volunteer firefighters actually reside in fire stations, rent-free, in exchange for their services as fire apparatus operators.  Many of these residents are students.  Not only does their presence assist the Fire District but it also minimizes their housing expenses while attending college.
