		<td class="Content"><p>	You will also become part of a family, a fraternity of sorts, comprised of many people from all walks of life, bound together by the common desire to help their fellow man.  The serious nature of what we do, coupled with the dependency we have on each other in an emergency, creates a very tight kinship among Boone County’s firefighters.  Very special and long-lasting friendships develop.  Despite the periodic intensity of our mission, these friendships truly establish a social environment which is very enjoyable – in other words, we also have fun!

Your firefighting equipment is called “Turnout Gear” and consists of a helmet, coat, pants, boots, head hood, gloves and suspenders. In addition, we provide you with a nomex (fire resistant) shirt for wildland firefighting incidents. Your turnout gear is utilized on rescues. The specialized breathing apparatus we use is called a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and is carried on our fire engines for use.

We have a comprehensive emergency response policy that is designed to insure your safety and the safety of the public while responding to an emergency. The cost of the necessary warning equipment is paid for by the volunteer firefighter.

	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>	That depends on your schedule and the number of emergencies occurring in your assigned station’s area. The Fire District averages approximately 3000 calls for emergency assistance each year.  Obviously, no one can respond to all of the calls.  The communications system allows the District to only activate those personnel who are assigned geographically to the area of the District in which the emergency exists.

Some are students and others are employed full-time and cannot leave work. We ask that you respond when you are able to do so but we do not expect you to jeopardize your employment or your education.
