		<td colspan="7" vAlign="top" class="Content">With the growing proliferation of clandestine drug labs in Missouri, the state has created regional clandestine drug lab response teams consisting of law enforcement officers from the various law enforcement agencies in the region.  As illegal drug labs contain, in most cases, significant quantities of hazardous materials such as ether and anhydrous ammonia, there is a need for hazardous materials capability on these teams.  The Boone County Fire District Hazardous Materials Response Unit is in integral part of central Missouri&#146;s drug task force and responds to clandestine drug lab scenes with law enforcement personnel to assist and support them in an effort to minimize the potential for explosion and fire by stabilizing the chemicals and to protect the law enforcement officers from unnecessary contamination.
