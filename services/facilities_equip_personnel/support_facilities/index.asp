		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">In 2000, the Boone County Fire Protection District moved its Headquarters Facility from a rather meager facility that had been used for 14 years to a new facility located at 2201 I-70 Drive Northwest in Columbia.  Many may know this as the old State Farm Claims Building at the northwest corner of I-70 and Stadium Blvd.  The building had been for sale for several years and the asking price had been approximately $3 million.  Following lengthy negotiations with State Farm, the Fire District obtained the property for $1.8 million.  Conversion costs were approximately 1.5 million dollars.  These improvements were made using reserve funds that had been established many years ago for this purpose.  As a result of the Fire District&#146;s involvement with the federal government through its Federal Urban Search and Rescue Task Force, additional federal funds were obtained for the conversion of the area of the building used to house and operate the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force (Missouri Task Force 1).  Additionally, funds were authorized by the voters of the Fire Protection District in a 1998 bond issue to build a new maintenance facility.  These funds were applied to the project for building conversion, thus maximizing those funds.

Through a cooperative agreement with the Boone County Commission, the Fire District will be developing this ground immediately north of the National Guard Armory on the west side of US Hwy 63.  A five story &#147;burn facility&#148; will be constructed in the summer of 2001 with a classroom facility to be constructed at a later date.  Additionally, the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force will develop several training props on the site that will simulate collapses of heavy steel and reinforced concrete construction.  Long-term development plans for the 40 acres include a hazardous materials training area, an emergency driving course, additional technical rescue props, rural water supply training areas and various fire suppression tactical simulators. </p>
		
			<p>The Boone County Sheriff&#146;s Department, FBI, Missouri National Guard, Missouri Fire and Rescue Institute at UMC, other Federal Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces and other local fire departments will also use this complex, through cooperative agreements.  </p>
