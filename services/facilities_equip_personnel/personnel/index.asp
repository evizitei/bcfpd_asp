		<td colspan="7" vAlign="top" class="Content">The Boone County Fire District operates a volunteer staff of approximately 300 men and women who, unselfishly, give of their time and talents.  The Boone County Fire District ranks as the largest roster of active volunteer firefighters in the United States according to the National Volunteer Fire Council.  The volunteer staff provides all fire suppression, emergency medicine, rescue and special services responses within the organization. The 186 personnel that participate in Missouri Task Force 1 also volunteer their time, as well.

To employ a full-time staff in place of the volunteers would cost the taxpayers of the Fire Protection District an additional $11.7 million.  The value provided by the volunteer firefighters is, obviously, very significant.

		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">All Boone County Fire District stations are also equipped with living quarters where volunteer firefighters actually reside.  Many volunteer firefighters are students or otherwise single men and women who, in exchange for their services as fire apparatus operators, live in our fire stations at no charge.  This facilitates a rapid response of equipment without the expense of paying full time people to staff the facilities.  
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">All fire stations are equipped with kitchen facilities and many are equipped with training rooms and other support facilities.  Those that are presently not equipped with individual training facilities have been constructed, as previously mentioned, in a modular fashion so that the training facilities can be added at a later date as funding becomes available.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">While not required by the building code, all facilities are fully protected by fire sprinkler systems and are equipped with fire alarm systems.  We believe it important to protect the taxpayers&#146; investment in this regard and, in leading by example, hope to encourage others to exceed minimal code requirements by installing built in fire protection systems.  Fire sprinklers are, unquestionably, the best fire defense available.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">Additionally, it is clearly recognized by the organization that the taxpayers have indeed provided these facilities for our use and residents are invited anytime to stop in and view their fire stations and fire equipment.  Those buildings that are constructed with training rooms are also made available for community, non-profit functions such as neighborhood meetings, etc.  Should you or your group be interested in using one of our facilities for such a meeting, please contact our administrative offices to make arrangements.
