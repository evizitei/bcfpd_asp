Fire stations and Fire District officers throughout the county are linked to the LAN via terminals located in Fire District stations and laptops provided to all officers. In addition to data transfer, reporting functions and communications systems, the laptops are used heavily on large-scale events in various incident management functions and are also used in researching chemical data at hazardous materials incidents.

		<td class="Content"><p>Many of the recent improvements to the LAN system, particularly in the fire stations and with the volunteer officers, was the result of a U.S. Department of Commerce grant acquired in 1998, one of only two grants given in Missouri.  Also, as a result of the grant, the computer lab at Midway Heights Elementary School was completely reequipped with new hardware and software. This Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIAPP) grant was the result of a grant partnership formed with Columbia Public Schools and the Midway Heights PTA.

		<td class="Content"><p>The Boone County Fire District now uses the Midway computer lab for computer training and the Midway elementary students may access the Fire District’s Survival Kids program and communicate directly with their firefighter/instructors via e-mail.  This has proven to be a very successful and productive partnership.
