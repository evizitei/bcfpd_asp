		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">The Boone County Fire District Emergency Medical System is a tiered response system, which utilizes Fire District firefighter/emergency medical technicians (EMT&#146;s), non-firefighter Fire District EMT&#146;s and hospital-based ambulance service paramedics to provide emergency medical care to its citizens and visitors.  Nearly 60% of the incidents the Boone County Fire District responds to are for medical emergencies.  Fire trucks from a local Fire District fire station and volunteer Fire District EMT&#146;s in their personal vehicles respond along with an ambulance from either Boone Hospital Center or the University Hospital (depending on the location of the incident) to the scene of the emergency.  Because fire stations are strategically located throughout the Fire District, Fire District EMT&#146;s usually arrive at the incident scene first and provide initial emergency medical care until the ambulance arrives.

		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">All Fire District members receive emergency medical training.  New members must complete a 112 hour Emergency Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B) Training Program and become licensed by the Missouri Department of Health.  The Fire District offers this EMT Training once a year.  This EMS training program teaches Fire District members how to provide airway management, oxygen therapy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), external defibrillation, bleeding control, bandaging, splinting and spinal immobilization.  Each fire truck is equipped with emergency medical equipment that is used by these EMT&#146;s to provide emergency medical care to medical emergency patients or victims of accidents.

		<td colspan="8" vAlign="top" class="Content">In 1990, the Fire District acquired twenty-five Automated External Defibrillators (AED&#146;s) and became the first fire department in Boone County to implement a first responder AED program.  These devices are used to provide an electric shock to a patient whose heart has stopped beating (cardiac arrest).  Since 1990, more than 20 victims of cardiac arrest have been saved by Fire District firefighter/EMT&#146;s.
