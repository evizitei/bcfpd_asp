		<td class="Content"><p>CERT is a program designed to prepare businesses, neighborhood groups and communities for major disasters. Lessons learned from the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida and tornadoes throughout the Midwest have shown that your local fire department, ambulance service and law enforcement may not arrive immediately to your business or neighborhood after a major disaster. Simply, you may be on your own from minutes to hours until professional help can arrive. CERT prepares you for that time period until help arrives.
