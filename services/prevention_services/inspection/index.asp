		<td class="Content"><p>The Boone County Fire District utilizes the BOCA building and fire protection codes in conjunction with NFPA codes and standards to ensure the life safety of homes and businesses within the Fire District. At the request of the property owner for residential or commercial occupancies, a Fire Marshal will conduct a preventive inspection to help you identify hazards within your home or business. There is no charge for this service.

		<td class="Content"><p>Periodically, we receive reports from persons who rent residential property or customers to a business who believe a fire code is being violated. When that information is received, the Fire Marshal will conduct a fire and life safety inspection under the authority granted by ordinances of the Boone County Fire District. Should a fire or life safety code violation be found, the Fire Marshal will determine the seriousness of the violation and inform the owner of the necessary corrective action. In extreme cases, corrective action may be needed immediately, such as a blocked fire exit. In other cases, a reasonable compliance date is established, allowing the owner to contract for repair, replacement or installation to comply with the Life Safety Code.
