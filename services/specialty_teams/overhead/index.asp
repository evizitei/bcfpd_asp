		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">In 1991, a prognosticator named Dr. Iben Browning forecasted that the New Madrid Fault would “erupt” in December of 1991 and massive destruction would occur in our state.  As a result of this forecast, Missouri’s fire service determined a need to develop a more systematic approach to the deployment of resources for an event such as an earthquake or other serious natural or man-made disaster.  The Missouri State Fire Mutual Aid plan was developed which, in part, provided for a systematic response of local resources throughout Missouri.

		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">While the earthquake in 1991 did not occur, this system has been used on numerous other occasions for ice storms, railroad de-railments involving hazardous materials and floods.  It was determined, through these experiences; many local fire departments were typically not capable of managing large numbers of resources sent from throughout the state to assist in the time of a disaster.  Following the model used on western wildfires, three overhead teams were developed in Missouri to assist local fire departments in this regard.  Overhead teams are 14–member management teams specifically designed to interface with local jurisdiction and assist with resource management and disaster planning.

		<td colspan="10" vAlign="top" class="Content">One overhead team is in St. Louis, one is Kansas City and the other is located in Boone County.  These teams may be deployed into a community to support the local fire chief and his organization in the management of massive resources.  These teams require an extensive amount of training and experience to provide this type of support.  The Boone County Fire Protection District is the sponsoring agency for one of these three teams and the majority of the team members come from within the organization.
