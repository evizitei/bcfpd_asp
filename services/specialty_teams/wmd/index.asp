		<td class="Content">Due to the growing threat of terrorist activity resulting from the use of weapons of mass destruction, the Boone County Fire Protection District has been engaged by the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency to respond throughout the state of Missouri, at their request, to assist local fire departments should they encounter an event involving weapons of mass destruction.  Weapons of mass destruction may include weapons which involve a biological, chemical or radiological threat.  The WMD response team is trained and equipped to provide initial assessment and identification of the material, provide basic medical treatment and provide decontamination for those affected.  The WMD team employs firefighters from the Fire District Hazardous Materials Team, law enforcement officers from the Boone County Sheriff’s Department and emergency medical personnel from area hospitals.  The state WMD response team is directly attached to Missouri Task Force 1 and is managed as a sub function of the task force.
