		<td class="Content"><p>Several years ago, volunteer firefighters within the organization, approached the department and asked if the organization would support an extension of the emergency medical system by subsidizing a bike team.  It was noted that a number of law enforcement agencies operated bike teams to facilitate more rapid deployment of resources in public gatherings or in remote areas.  It was felt that the same concept could be used to extend emergency medical care and capability in those same environments.

These personnel are used at events such as the Memorial Day Airshow, parades, large events on the many biking trails within our community, Show-Me Games and other large public events throughout the community.

We ask that when they are interested in a routine bike ride, they take the necessary equipment along with them so that, should they encounter an incident requiring emergency medical care, they are in a position to provide care and activate the system for additional support.
