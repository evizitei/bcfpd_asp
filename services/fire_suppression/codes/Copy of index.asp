	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>Prior to 1975, there were no construction codes outside the city limits of Columbia.  The results of inadequate construction were proven time and time again under fire conditions in Boone County.  Improper installation of fire places, furnaces, etc. resulted in many unnecessary fires and improper construction involving fire separations, sheetrock, smoke detectors, etc. caused more rapid and extensive fire spread thus resulting in higher risk to life and higher property loss.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>In the 1970’s the Boone County Fire Protection District undertook an effort to adopt and enforce building and fire safety codes in Boone County.  To say the least, this was extremely controversial and was met with a great deal of resistance, the Fire District persevered and, in concert with County Government developed a code adoption and enforcement program that has proven its worth many times over in the last few years.  The Fire District, on almost a daily basis, sees the positive results of this code program with reduced incidents of fire and reduced magnitude of fire when they do occur.  
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>Unlike many other areas of the state, the Fire District and the County Government believe it inappropriate to require builders, developers and homeowners to comply with two separate code programs – one within Boone County Government and one within the government structure of the Boone County Fire Protection District.  Therefore, a cooperative arrangement was developed between the two governmental functions to ensure minimal “hassle” for the customer and, simultaneously, ensure that proper code enforcement and inherence was maintained.  
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="Content"><p>Today the code program is very effective and has served as a model for many other areas of the state of Missouri as they have also taken on the issue of building and fire safety code adoption and enforcement.
